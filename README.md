# CS-255-System-Design

This repo was the major assignment for my CS 255: Systems Analysis and Design class at Southern New Hampshire University.

This design was created for the DriverPass project, which was completed over the course of the term. DriverPass is a company that provides driver education to help students pass their DMV exams. We were contracted by DriverPass to design a new online system that allows customers to make appointments, track their progress, and view their practice exam results. Instructors benefit from a centralized appointments database that helps them manage student appointments and provide feedback. Secretaries at DriverPass can manage pre-existing appointments, while the IT Officer can access the audit log for every appointment. Additionally, the Owner has the ability to manage the various educational packages offered by the business.

In the Business Requirements document, we detailed the various needs of the client's online system while providing a development schedule for the work we planned on performing. In the System Design document, we detail a UML use case diagram, two Activity Digrams detailing the process of scheduling an appointment and how the owner would check the audit log. We also detail a UML Sequence diagram that walks through the different system interactions needed for a customer to schedule a new appointment.
